This was a personal project inspired by CodeCademy.
It is a web page that tries to create intrest in a shop called Tea Cozy.
Which is a tea shop that sells different brews of tea and pasteries and has 3 locations in Portland. 

It primarily was a challenge to replicate something 1:1 that was given by a contractor.
As i was given a detailed mockup and the goal to replicate it as best i could.
